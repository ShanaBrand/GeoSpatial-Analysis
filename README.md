# Geo Spatial Data Analysis

In this analysis I used Python geodata pandas library to offer solutions to several real-world problems like:

- Where should a global non-profit expand its reach in remote areas of the Philippines?
- How do purple martins, a threatened bird species, travel between North and South America? Are the birds travelling to conservation areas?
- Which areas of Japan could potentially benefit from extra earthquake reinforcement?
- Which Starbucks stores in California are strong candidates for the next Starbucks Reserve Roastery location?
- Does New York City have sufficient hospitals to respond to motor vehicle collisions? Which areas of the city have gaps in coverage?

Perform visualizations of:
- crime in the city of Boston, 
- examine health facilities in Ghana, 
- explore top universities in Europe, and
- track releases of toxic chemicals in the United States.
